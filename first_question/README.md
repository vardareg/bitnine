# **Setting Up the GCC Compiler**

## **Linux**
On a Ubuntu Linux system, if you don't already have GCC installed, you can install it through the terminal with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc
```
## **macOS**
On macOS, you can install GCC through the Homebrew package manager.
```bash
brew install gcc
```
## **Windows**
On Windows, you can download and install MinGW or Cygwin.
# Compiling and Running the Source Code
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your C file is located using the cd command.
3. Compile the source code with the GCC compiler using the following command:
```bash
gcc -o bitnine-1.c
```
4. Run the compiled program with the following command:
```bash
./bitnine-1
```
You should then see the output of the program in the terminal.
