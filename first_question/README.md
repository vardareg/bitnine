# Compiling and Running the Source Code
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your C file is located using the cd command.
3. Compile the source code with the GCC compiler using the following command:
```bash
gcc -o bitnine-1.c
```
4. Run the compiled program with the following command:
```bash
./bitnine-1
```
You should then see the output of the program in the terminal.
